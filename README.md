## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to design and implement a low-cost autonomous mobile robot platform that integrates:

- Embedded control using Arduino (Makeblock Auriga)
- Sensor-based autonomous navigation
- Bluetooth-based Android smartphone control
- Multiple intelligent operating modes

The system is intended as a practical educational platform for learning and experimenting with mobile robotics, embedded systems, control algorithms, and human–robot interaction.
